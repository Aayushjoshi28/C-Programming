#Chapter 2: C Instructions

## Types of Instructions

*Three Types of Instructions*
1. Type Declaration Instruction - Used to Declare the type of variables
2. Arithmetic Instruction - Used to Perform Arithmetic Operations on constants and variables.
3. Control Instruction - Used to control the sequence of execution of various statements.

### Type Declaration Instruction
The type of variable is written at the beginning of the main() function.

### Arithmetic Instruction
*,/,-,+ are the arithmetic operators used in these instructions.

1. C allows only 1 variable on the left side of the =.
2. C allows the use of modular division operator %. This operator cannot be applied on float.
3. No operator is assumed to be present. It must be written explicitly.
4. There is no operator in C to perform exponentiation.

#### Integer and Float Conversions

1. Integer & Integer Yields Integer
2. Real & Real Yields Real
3. Integer & Real Yields Real

#### Hierarchy of Operations 

Follow the BODMAS Rule

#### Associativity of Operators
Whenever there is a tie between two arithmetic operator it can be solved using left to right.

###Control Instructions
They determine the flow of the program.

There are four types of control instructions in C.
1. Sequence Control Instruction
2. Selection or Decision Control Instruction
3. Repetition or Loop Control Instruction
4. Case Control Instruction
